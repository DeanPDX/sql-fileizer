# Sample Config Files
Here are some config files to do common tasks:

* [Generate scripts from stored procedures](ScriptsFromProcs.xml)
* [Generate scripts from user-defined functions](ScriptsFromFunctions.xml)
* [Generate scripts from views](ScriptsFromViews.xml)

Give them a try and use them as a building block for creating your own config files.
